                    A heart attack occurs when an artery that sends blood and oxygen to the heart is blocked. Fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits build up over time, forming plaques in the heart's arteries. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form. The clot can block arteries, causing a heart attack. During a heart attack, a lack of blood flow causes the tissue in the heart muscle to die.A heart attack is also called a myocardial infarction.Prompt treatment is needed for a heart attack to prevent death. Call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.

                <h1 className='font-bold'>Symptoms</h1>
                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>
                    Symptoms of a heart attack vary. Some people have mild symptoms. Others have severe symptoms. Some people have no symptoms.
                </p>
                <h1 className='font-bold'> Common heart attack symptoms include:</h1>
                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chest pain that may feel like pressure, tightness, pain, squeezing or aching</li>
                    <li>Pain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth</li>
                    <li>Cold sweat</li>
                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                    <li>Heartburn or indigestion</li>
                    <li>Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness</li>
                    <li>Nausea</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Women may have atypical symptoms such as brief or sharp pain felt in the neck, arm or back</li>
                </ul>
                    Some heart attacks strike suddenly. But many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. Chest pain or pressure (angina) that keeps happening and doesn't go away with rest may be an early warning sign. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart.
                </p>

                <h1 className='font-bold'>Causes</h1>
                <h1>What causes a heart attack?</h1>
                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>
                    Most heart attacks happen because of a blockage in one of the blood vessels that supply your heart. Most often, this occurs because of plaque, a sticky substance that can build up on the insides of your arteries (similar to how pouring grease down your kitchen sink can clog your home plumbing). That buildup is called atherosclerosis. When there’s a large amount of this atherosclerotic buildup in the blood vessels to your heart, this is called coronary artery disease. Sometimes, plaque deposits inside the coronary (heart) arteries can break open or rupture, and a blood clot can get stuck where the rupture happened. If the clot blocks the artery, this can deprive the heart muscle of blood and cause a heart attack.Heart attacks are possible without ruptured plaque, but this is rare and only accounts for about 5% of all heart attacks.
                
                <h1 className='font-bold'>This kind of heart attack can occur for the following reasons:</h1>
            
                    Coronary artery spasm.
                    Rare medical conditions, like any disease that causes unusual narrowing of blood vessels.
                    Trauma that causes tears or ruptures in your coronary arteries.
                    Obstruction that came from somewhere else in your body, like a blood clot or air bubble (embolism) that ends up in a coronary artery.
                    Eating disorders.
                    Over time, these can damage your heart and ultimately result in a heart attack.

                    Anomalous coronary arteries (a heart issue you’re born with where the coronary arteries are in abnormal positions. Compression of these causes a heart attack).
                    Other conditions that can cause your heart not to receive as much blood as it should for a prolonged period of time, such as when blood pressure is too low, oxygen is too low or your heart rate is too fast.
                </p>

                <h1 className='font-bold'>What are the risk factors for a heart attack?</h1>

                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>
                    Several key factors affect your risk of having a heart attack. Unfortunately, some of these heart attack risk factors aren’t things you can modify:

                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Age and sex:</h1> Your risk of heart attack increases as you get older. Your sex influences when your risk of a heart attack starts to increase. For people assigned male at birth (AMAB), the risk of heart attack increases at age 45. For people assigned female at birth (AFAB), the risk of heart attack increases at age 50 or after menopause.

                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Family history of heart disease:</h1> If you have a parent or sibling with a history of heart disease or heart attack — especially at a younger age — your risk is even greater because your genetics are similar to theirs. Your risk increases if a first-degree relative (biological sibling or parent) received a heart disease diagnosis at age 55 or younger if they’re AMAB, or at age 65 or younger if they’re AFAB.

                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Lifestyle:</h1> Lifestyle choices you make that aren’t good for your heart can increase your risk of having a heart attack. This includes things like smoking, eating high-fat foods, lack of physical activity, drinking too much alcohol and drug use.
                    Certain health conditions: Some health conditions put stress on your heart and increase your risk for heart attack. This includes diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, eating disorders or a history of preeclampsia.
                </p>
                <h1>What are the complications of a heart attack?</h1>
                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>Complications associated with heart attacks include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms).</li>
                        <li>Heart failure.</li>
                        <li>Heart valve problems.</li>

                </p>
                <h1 className='font-bold text-center'>Diagnosis and Tests</h1>
                <h1 className='font-bold'>How do I know if I’ve had a heart attack?</h1>
                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>
                    Healthcare providers usually diagnose heart attacks in an emergency room setting. 
                    If you have heart attack symptoms, you should undergo a physical examination. 
                    A provider will check your pulse, blood oxygen levels and blood pressure and 
                    listen to your heart and lung sounds. They’ll also ask you about the symptoms you experienced. 
                    They might ask someone who was with you to describe what happened.
                </p>
                <h1 className='font-bold'>What tests will be done to diagnose a heart attack?</h1>
                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>
                    A healthcare provider will diagnose a heart attack using the following:
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Blood tests:</h1> One of the most reliable ways to diagnose a heart attack is to check for cardiac troponin in your blood. During a heart attack, the damage to heart muscle cells always causes this chemical marker to appear in your bloodstream.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG):</h1> This is one of the first tests you get when you come to an ER with heart attack symptoms. Your heart’s electrical signals can help tell if an injury is occurring as well as if there are any rhythm abnormalities.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Echocardiogram:</h1> Using ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves), an echocardiogram generates a picture of the inside and outside of your heart. It can show how well your heart is squeezing and how well the valves are working.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Coronary angiogram or heart catheterization:</h1> This is a procedure that uses X-rays and contrast dye to show the blood vessels to your heart and can help determine if there are any blockages.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Heart computed tomography (CT) scan:</h1> This creates a highly detailed scan of your heart and its blood vessels to show if there’s any significant narrowing or hardening of the major coronary arteries.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Heart MRI (magnetic resonance imaging):</h1> This test uses a powerful magnetic field and computer processing to create an image of your heart. It can show problems with the blood flow in the arteries to your heart.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Exercise stress test:</h1> This test can use an ECG, echocardiogram or nuclear scans while you’re physically active to help show if your heart is receiving enough blood flow.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Nuclear heart scans:</h1> These scans use a radioactive dye a provider injects into your blood and computer-enhanced methods like computed tomography (CT) to find areas of your heart that aren’t receiving as much blood or are injured. These scans can be single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.</p>
                <h1 className='font-bold text-center'>Management and Treatment</h1>
                <h1 className='font-bold'> How is a heart attack treated?</h1>
                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>Treating a heart attack means restoring blood flow to the affected heart muscle as soon as possible. This can happen in a variety of ways, ranging from medication to surgery. Treatment will likely include several of the following methods.</p>

                <h1 className='font-bold'>Supplementary oxygen</h1>

                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>People having trouble breathing or with low blood oxygen levels often receive supplementary oxygen along with other heart attack treatments. You can breathe the oxygen either through a tube that sits just below your nose or a mask that fits over your nose and mouth. This increases the amount of oxygen circulating in your blood and reduces the strain on your heart.</p>

                <h1 className='font-bold'>Medications</h1>

                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>These may include:

                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Anti-clotting medications:</h1> This includes aspirin and other blood-thinning medicines.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Nitroglycerin:</h1> This medicine relieves chest pain and causes blood vessels to widen so blood can pass through more easily.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Thrombolytic (clot-busting) medications:</h1> Providers use these only within the first 12 hours after a heart attack.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Anti-arrhythmia medications:</h1> Heart attacks can often cause malfunctions in your heart’s normal beating rhythm called arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening. Anti-arrhythmia medications can stop or prevent these malfunctions.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Pain medications:</h1> The most common pain medication people receive during heart attack care is morphine. This can help alleviate chest pain.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Beta-blockers:</h1> These medications help slow down your heart rate so your heart can recover from the injury of a heart attack.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Antihypertensives:</h1> These medications decrease your blood pressure and can help your heart recover from the injury of a heart attack.
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>Statins:</h1> These medications help stabilize the plaque in your heart’s blood vessels so that they’re less likely to rupture. They also help reduce cholesterol and the chances of having another heart attack.
                </p>
                <h1 className='font-bold'>Percutaneous coronary intervention</h1>

                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>Providers restore circulation to your affected heart muscle with a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or angioplasty.

                    Opening your artery with a catheter is critical in restoring blood flow. The sooner that happens, the better the chance of a good outcome. Providers use a metric called “door-to-balloon time” to measure their ability to treat a heart attack. This is the average time it takes for people to undergo PCI after they first come into the emergency room. If you receive PCI, your provider may place a stent at the site of the blockage. The stent helps hold your artery open so another blockage doesn’t happen in the same spot.
                </p>

                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>Coronary artery bypass grafting

                    People who have severe blockages of their coronary arteries may undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Providers often call this open-heart surgery or bypass surgery.

                    CABG involves using a blood vessel from elsewhere in your body (usually your chest, arm or leg) to construct a detour for blood. This reroutes blood around one or more blocked artery sections and brings blood to your heart muscle.
                </p>

                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'> Complications/side effects of the treatment
                    <h1 className='font-bold'> Treatment side effects vary by treatment and may include:</h1>

                    <ul className='ml-12'>
                        <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>Nausea and vomiting.</li>
                        <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>Weakness.</li>
                        <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>Lightheadedness.</li>
                        <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>Bleeding.</li>
                        <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>Infection.</li>
                        <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>Damage to a blood vessel.</li>
                        <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>Arrhythmia.</li >
                        <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>Kidney issues.</li >
                        <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>Stroke.</li >
                    </ul >
                </p >
                How soon after treatment will I feel better ?
                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>In general, your heart attack symptoms should decrease as you receive treatment. You’ll likely have some lingering weakness and fatigue during your hospital stay and for several days after. Your healthcare provider will give you guidance on rest, medications to take and more.

                    Recovery from the treatments also varies, depending on the method of treatment. The average hospital stay for a heart attack is between four and five days. In general, expect to stay in the hospital for the following length of time:

                    Medication only: People who only receive medication have an average hospital stay of about six days.
                    PCI: Recovering from PCI is easier than surgery because it’s a less invasive method for treating a heart attack. The average length of stay for PCI is about four days.
                    CABG: Recovery from heart bypass surgery takes longer because it’s a major surgery. The average length of stay for CABG is about eight to 12 days.
                    Prevention</p>
                Can a heart attack be prevented ?
                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'>In general, there are many things that you can do that may prevent a heart attack. However, there are some factors you can’t change — especially your family history — that can still lead to a heart attack despite your best efforts. Still, reducing your risk can postpone when you have a heart attack and reduce the severity if you have one.</p>

                How can I lower my risk ?
                <p className='bg-yellow-500 p-4 m-4'> Although several risk factors can’t be modified, there are many ways you can help yourself and reduce your risk of a heart attack. These include:

                    Scheduling a checkup: Find a primary care provider (PCP) and see them at least once a year for a checkup or wellness visit. An annual checkup can catch many of the early warning signs of heart disease, including changes that you can’t feel. These include your blood pressure, blood sugar levels, cholesterol levels and more.
                    Quitting tobacco products: This includes smokeless tobacco and all vaping products.
                    Exercising regularly: Aim for 30 minutes of moderately intense physical activity five days a week.
                    Eating nutritious foods: Examples include the Mediterranean or Dash diets. Eating plant-based meals is an excellent alternative to eating lots of processed meats and saturated fats.
                    Maintaining a weight that’s healthy for you: Your primary care provider can advise you on a healthy target weight and provide resources and guidance to help you reach that goal.
                    Managing your existing health conditions: This includes high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes.
                    Reducing your stress: Consider techniques such as yoga, deep breathing and meditation.
                    Taking your medications as prescribed: Don’t just take medications when you remember to or when you have a doctor’s appointment coming up.
                    Keeping all your medical appointments: Seeing your healthcare providers regularly can help uncover heart-related issues or other medical problems you didn’t know you had. This can also help treat problems sooner rather than later.</p>
