            <h1>Anemia</h1>
            Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood produces a lower-than-normal amount of healthy red blood cells. If you have anemia, your body does not get enough oxygen-rich blood. The lack of oxygen can make you feel tired or weak. You may also have shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, or an irregular heartbeat. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionexternal link, about 3 million people in the United States have anemia.
            There are many types of anemia, including:
            Iron-deficiency anemia
            Vitamin B12-deficiency anemia
            Hemolytic anemia
            Mild anemia is a common and treatable condition that can develop in anyone. It may come about suddenly or over time, and may be caused by your diet, medicines you take, or another medical condition. Anemia can also be chronic, meaning it lasts a long time and may never go away completely. Some types of anemia are inherited. The most common type of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia.
            Some people are at a higher risk for anemia, including women during their menstrual periods and pregnancy. People who do not get enough iron or certain vitamins and people who take certain medicines or treatments are also at a higher risk.

            Anemia may also be a sign of a more serious condition, such as bleeding in your stomach, inflammation from an infection, kidney disease, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Your doctor will use your medical history, a physical exam, and test results to diagnose anemia.

            Treatments for anemia depend on the type you have and how serious it is. For some types of mild to moderate anemia, you may need iron supplements, vitamins, or medicines that make your body produce more red blood cells. To prevent anemia in the future, your doctor may also suggest healthy eating changes.
            <h1>What causes anemia?</h1>
            Many things can cause it. For example, iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. You can develop this type if you don’t get enough iron from the food you eat, or if you lose blood from an injury or illness. Healthcare providers classify anemia as being acquired or inherited.

            Acquired anemias
            You develop or acquire anemia from something that happens during your lifetime, like a condition that causes it. Acquired anemias include:

            Anemia of chronic disease: You can develop this condition if you have an illness that causes chronic inflammation, making it hard for your body to use the iron it needs to make red blood cells.
            Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: In this case, your immune system attacks your red blood cells.
            Macrocytic anemia and megaloblastic anemia: These are types of anemia that develop when your bone marrow makes unusually large red blood cells. Certain medical conditions and vitamin deficiencies may cause these types of anemia. Healthcare providers may call these conditions vitamin deficiency anemia.
            Normocytic anemia: In this type, you have fewer red blood cells than usual. There are many causes of normocytic anemia.
            Pernicious anemia: This condition, which is one of the causes of vitamin B12 deficiency, is an autoimmune condition that prevents your body from absorbing vitamin B12.
            You can also develop anemia if you have certain chronic diseases. Anemia may be a symptom or complication of the following:

            Autoimmune diseases.
            Cancer.
            Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
            Kidney disease.
            Liver disease.
            Thyroid disease.
            Inherited anemias
            An inherited anemia is when you’re born with the condition. Inherited anemias include:

            Diamond-Blackfan anemia: This inherited disorder keeps your bone marrow from making enough red blood cells.
            Fanconi anemia: This is a rare blood disorder. People with Fanconi anemia have an increased risk of blood disorders, including anemia.
            Sickle cell anemia: This condition changes your red blood cells’ shape, turning round, flexible discs into stiff and sticky sickle cells that block blood flow.
            Thalassemia: In this condition, your body produces less hemoglobin, resulting in small red blood cells and anemia.
            Other anemia types
            Some types of anemia may be inherited but can also be acquired:

            Aplastic anemia: This anemia happens when stem cells in your bone marrow don’t make enough blood cells.
            Hemolytic anemia: In this anemia, your red blood cells break down or die faster than usual.
            Microcytic anemia: This anemia happens when your red blood cells don’t have enough hemoglobin so they’re smaller than usual. Microcytic anemia occurs with iron deficiency, thalassemia, and sideroblastic anemia. It also occurs in some people who have anemia of chronic disease.
            Sideroblastic anemia: Sideroblastic anemia results from abnormal iron use during red blood cell development.
            Diagnosis and Tests
            How is anemia diagnosed?
            Your healthcare provider will ask questions about your symptoms. As anemia happens when you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells, they’ll do blood tests, including:

            Complete blood count (CBC): Healthcare providers use this test to check on all of your blood cells, with a focus on your red blood cells. Medical pathologists examine blood samples to count your red blood cells. They also examine your red blood cells’ size and shape. Healthcare providers may use this test to check on your vitamin B12 or B9 levels.
            Hemoglobin test: Hemoglobin is the main component of red blood cells. The test is often used to detect anemia.
            Hematocrit test: This test measures the percentage of red blood cells in your blood.
            Peripheral blood smear: Healthcare providers examine your red blood cells under a microscope to assess blood cell size and shape.
            Reticulocyte count: Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells. This test checks if your bone marrow is producing enough healthy red blood cells.
            What are the complications of anemia?
            Chronic anemia can cause serious medical issues like heart attack, heart failure and organ damage. Chronic anemia is anemia that healthcare providers don’t diagnose and treat or that continues despite treatment.

            Management and Treatment
            How is anemia treated?
            Your treatment will vary depending on the cause. If you have anemia because you have an underlying condition, your provider will treat that condition. But they may also do the following treatments specifically for anemia. Treatments may include dietary supplements or medications.

            Dietary supplements
            Your provider may recommend the following supplements for anemia:

            Iron supplements: This supplement comes in capsules or tablets that you can take by mouth with a glass of water.
            Folic acid supplements: Vitamin B9 (folate) is an essential vitamin that helps your body form red blood cells and DNA, which are the building blocks of your body.
            Vitamin B12 supplements: Vitamin B12 supplements support the production of healthy red blood cells.
            Medications
            Providers may prescribe medications for anemia, including:

            Erythropoietin: This medication helps your bone marrow to produce more blood stem cells.
            Immunosuppressants: If you have anemia because of an autoimmune disorder, your provider may prescribe medication that keeps your immune system from attacking your red blood cells.
            <h1>Procedures</h1>

            In some cases, your provider may recommend:

            Blood transfusion to replace red blood cells.
            Stem cell (bone marrow) transplant to replace unhealthy blood stem cells with healthy ones.
            Surgery to treat internal bleeding that’s causing anemia.
            <h1>Can I fix anemia by myself?</h1>
            Most of the time, anemia causes mild symptoms and is a short-term issue that you may be able to manage by changing your diet or taking supplements once a healthcare provider concludes that anemia is the reason why you have certain symptoms.
            But anemia may cause symptoms of other diseases. For example, something other than anemia may be why you feel exhausted no matter how much rest you get.
            Talk to your healthcare provider if you have fatigue or other changes in your body that don’t go away within two weeks. They’ll find out what’s causing your symptoms and treat the condition.

            <h1>Prevention</h1>
            <h1>Can anemia be prevented?</h1>
            You may be able to prevent the most common type of anemia, iron-deficiency anemia, by including iron-rich foods in your everyday meals and snacks. But there are other types of anemia you can’t prevent, including inherited disorders.

            <h1>Outlook / Prognosis</h1>
            <h1>Can you live a normal life with anemia?</h1>
            That depends on your situation. Treatment may manage anemia symptoms. But many things can cause it, like incurable inherited disorders and chronic diseases. Chronic anemia, like anemia that goes without treatment, can cause serious complications, including organ damage. If you have anemia, ask your healthcare provider what you can expect.

            <h1>Living With</h1>
            <h1>How do I take care of myself?</h1>
            While some types of anemia are short-term and mild, others can last a lifetime. Regardless, there are several things you can do to help manage symptoms. Here are some suggestions:
            Follow a healthy eating plan: Poor eating habits are the primary reason why people develop anemia. Ask your healthcare provider about iron-rich foods and other foods you should eat to meet your body’s nutritional needs.
            Take your supplements as directed.
            Drink up: Drink lots of water so you stay hydrated.
            Keep moving: Regular exercise is part of a healthy lifestyle. But be sure to check with your healthcare provider about ways to exercise safely.
            Protect against infection: Wash your hands often. Ask your provider about vaccinations that help prevent viral and bacterial infections.
            When should I seek medical care?
            If you have anemia, you should check with your provider if your symptoms get worse despite treatment or if you notice changes in your body that may be new symptoms.
